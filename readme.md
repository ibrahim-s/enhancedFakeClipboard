## More Information

This addon is really an old addon, it sustains time, and still usable and useful till now.

It is a modified version of FakeClipboardAnnouncement addon.

Some features I may mention for instance: If in edit controls you want to copy or cut text, and it is not selected, the addon will warn you that text is not selected.

and like wise, in a folder if you want to copy or cut a file and it is not selected, the addon will warn you also.
